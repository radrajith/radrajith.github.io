description: Constructed, optimized, and evaluated targeted Automatic Test Pattern Generation(ATPG) tool using the PODEM algorithm for fault detection. The PODEM algorithm is implmented using functions like backtrace, getObjective, checkFault, and simulateFullCircuit. In addition, the updateDfrontier function will be used to recursively run through the benchmark circuits from primary outputs to primary inputs looking for D or Dbar. utilizing gates in the Dfrontier the ATPG will generate the testvectors. In order to increase the speed of the algorithm, event driven simulation was implemented for 10x speed increase. The test vector size were reduced by running fault simulator and utilizing donâ€™t cares in the test vector to obtain only unique faults. SCOAP metrics were calculated for each inputs and output of the gates and were used to make smarter decision while running algorithm. More details to be added.
