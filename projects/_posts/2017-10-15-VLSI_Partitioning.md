description: Fiduccia-Mattheyses(FM) is an algorithm which handles the problem of dividing a large netlist, with many nodes, into two sets under particular size constraints. Partitioning is a key part of Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) design. VLSI design can typically be broken into the main stages of partitioning, floorplanning, placement, and routing.  In Partitioning, the goal is minimizing the cutset size, which is defined as the number of edges connecting two partitions. Of the many approaches taken to solve this problem, the most common is the Kernighan-Lin(KL) approach. This approach involves swapping pairs of nodes to decrease the cutset size.  However, this algorithm is limited to only balanced partitions, and does not include the concept of a hyper edge. Fiduccia-Mattheyses is a modification of the KL approach to include the concept of hyperedges, and adds a bucket list data structure to decrease the time complexity of the algorithm from O(n^3) to O(n^2). --A group project done along with Ryan and Nick
