description:  I wanted to have a night lamp that will turn on after sunset and turn off in the middle of the night/ sunrise. The timers available at Home Depot or other hardware stores only allows to set a time. Since in USA there is daylight saving time, it had to be changed. To solve this, the outlet is connected to the internet to obtain the sunset timings daily. This project used Spark core to control the power outlet and IFTTT API to obtain the timings of sunset/sunrise/weather. As shown in the video at the above link, the Outlet was turned into a IoT device. <b>This project was a featured project on instructables website on Jan 11, 2016.</b>
