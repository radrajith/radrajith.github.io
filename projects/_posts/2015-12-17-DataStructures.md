  <h3 align="left"><a id = "Arrays">>Course Planner using Lists</a></h3>
  <p class="text-justify">The course planner is designed using list/array data structure where students can record the courses they want to take in order of preference. A course contains general information such as course name, course code, course section, instructor, etc. The planner should be able to record a total of 50 courses. The program provides the ability to add courses, remove courses, get courses, print the planner, Filter courses, search courses, backup planner and obtain the size of the planner.

  <h3 align="left"><a id = "LinkedLists">>Train Car Manager using Double Linked List</a></h3>
  <img src="img/portfolio/datastructures/hw2.PNG"></img>
  <p class="text-justify">Designed train car manager for a commercial train, modelled using a Double-Linked List data structure. Train car manager consists of a chain of train cars, each of which contains a product load. A product load has a weight, a value, and can be dangerous or safe. The train car manager will be able to add and remove cars from the train, set the product load for each car, and determine useful properties of the train, such as it's length, weight, total value, and whether it contains any dangerous product loads. All the properties completes in O(1) time complexity. <p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radrajith/Data-Structures-in-Java/master/hw%232/Assignment%20Requirements/hw2(8).html">Train Car Manager Project Requirements</a>

  <h3 align="left"><a id = "Stacks">>Code Tracer to return Big-Oh order of complexity using Stacks</a></h3>
  <img src="img/portfolio/datastructures/hw3.PNG"></img>
  <p class="text-justify">Most programming languages are organized as structured blocks of statements, with some blocks nested within others. Functions, which are examples of such blocks, execute statements and other blocks contained within the them. Similarly, flow control strucutres, such as for and while loops, are blocks which can be executed several times subject to some condition. The Python programming language is an example of a language which follows this principle, and is even flexible enough to allow functions to be nested within functions!.

  <p class = "text-justify">A code tracer program is designed which takes the name of a Python file containing a single function and outputs the Big-Oh order of complexity of that function. BlockStack class is implemented to determine the complexity of blocks with nested blocks, and use the rules of Big-Oh complexity to determine the total complexity for the function.

  <h3 align="left"><a id = "Queues">>Network of routers simulator using Queues</a></h3>
  <img src="img/portfolio/datastructures/hw4.PNG"></img>
  <p class="text-justify">Imitating a simple network of routers by writing a simulator using Queues. In the field of networking, information is packed into a single entity called a packet. A packet contains the sender's information, and also extra overhead bits that describes certain properties of the packet. Some of these bits are used to determine the path it takes to maneuver through the network. Packets travel through routers across the network, until they have arrived to their specified destination.

  <h3 align="left"><a id = "BinaryTrees">>Build a shell/Bash terminal using Binary trees</a></h3>
  <img src="img/portfolio/datastructures/hw5.PNG"></img>
  <p class="text-justify">Modeling a file system using a ternary (3-child) tree data structure. In most operating systems, files are stored in directories. These directories may contain other directories along with files. In addition to a file system, an OS typically also provides a shell, which is an interface allowing you to run programs and move through the file system.

  <h3 align="left"><a id = "HashTable">>Create a Auction site with Ebay listing data using Hash Table</a></h3>
  <p class="text-justify">Designing the Auction site data base using Hash Table Data structure. A very basic array can store information without a problem, but is inefficient when we are constantly storing and searching for data. The table is created to increase the efficiency and avoid such problems. Tables store data using a tuple <Key, Value>. Ideally, this will reduce the algorithm to O(1). For this project, real auction data from ebay is utilized. The data will be in the form of an XML file. The program will read this xml file and build a hash table based on the data.

  <h3 align="left"><a id="Graph">>Simplified version of Google's PageRank Algorithm using Graphs</a></h3><img src="img/portfolio/datastructures/hw7.PNG"></img>
  <p class="text-justify">Implemented a directed graph of WebPage objects by reading pages.txt and links.txt. Once the graph is constructed, the program will run a basic search engine that prompts the user to enter a keyword. The program will then perform the PageRank algorithm, and display the pages to the user in tabular form sorted by descending PageRank.
